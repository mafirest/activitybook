A.	Installing and configure on GCP
  The list below is steps to deploy the application on GCP.
    •	Create a new VM Instance
    •	Install LAMP stack
    •	Transfer file or get the code directly in zip file
    •	Configure and import database.
  The application is supporting 33 languages. It is a useful feature for diverse global users.
B.	Deploying with Docker
  Due to the need to implement the application as fast as possible and adjust a web application resource, in this section, we describe the way to use Docker [11] container technology to deploy the web applications on GCP. Implementing container and configure DB runs are follows:
  1)	Deploying container docker hub
    In this example, we build a new Docker container based on the image docker-LAMP mattrayner/lamp: latest-1804.
    With a Dockerfile:
        FROM mattrayner/lamp:latest-1804
        COPY html/ /var/www/html/
        CMD ["/run.sh"]
        repositories: thuytrieu/timapp 
        After package code, one can use docker command to build container then push to docker hub with repositories thuytrieu 
        docker build -t thuytrieu/timapp:latest . 
        docker run -d -p 8082:80 --name timapp thuytrieu/timapp:latest; 
        docker push thuytrieu/timapp 
        docker ps 
        docker push thuytrieu/timapp 
        docker stop app_name 
        docker rm app_name 
        docker images 
        docker container ls 
  2)	Configure database
    The access to the running container through:
        docker exec -it id_container bash
        configure the file configure.php
        restart the service
